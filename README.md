# Overview

This software is a not-so-simple hello world program. In the absence of the "PyAutoGui"
library, this program simply outputs hello world to the console. But, if the PyAutoGui
module is available, it will instead make a pop-up with hello world.

Most hello world programs are so boring and simple (which, to be fair, is kinda the point
of a hello world program), and I wanted to create one with a bit more flair!
